% ****************************** Thesis Abstract ******************************

% Don't forget you can use the 'abstract' option to print only the titlepage and abstract.

\begin{abstract}
The abstract should be approximately 300 words and should give a synopsis of the thesis stating the nature and scope of the work undertaken and of the contribution made to the knowledge of the subject treated. It should appear on its own as a single page (and should be headed by the author's full name and the title of the thesis, but nobody seems to do this).
\end{abstract}
