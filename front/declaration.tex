% ****************************** Thesis Declaration ******************************

\begin{declaration}
Bournemouth's instructions for a PhD thesis declaration are:

\textit{The author should draw attention to any material contained in the thesis that has been presented before. If the thesis is based on joint research, the nature and extent of the author's individual contribution should be stated. The declaration should follow the acknowledgement, under a separate heading.}

There is no standard declaration available, so feel free to find one online and tailor it to your own requirements, providing you meet the above statement.

% Author and date will be inserted automatically from thesis.tex \author \degreedate.
